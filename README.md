# ALX System Engineering & Devops
## Introduction
This project is for the ALX SE program it is intended for educational use in learning about the Linux Shell basics and then going all the way into system engineering and devops.

All projects were tested will be auto-corrected with Ubuntu 20.04LTS.
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All scripts should be exactly two lines long (**$ wc -l file** should print 2)
* All files should end with a new line ([why?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789))
* The first line of all your files should be exactly **#!/bin/bash**
* A **README.md** file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A **README.md** file at the root of the folder of all the directories of all projects describing what each script is doing
* Usage of backticks, **&&**, **||** or **;** is not allowed
* All scripts must be executable. To make file executable use the **chmod** command: **chmod u+x file**. Later we'll learn more about how chmod is utilized.
